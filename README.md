ALGLIB is a cross-platform numerical analysis and data mining library. It supports several programming languages (C++, C#, Delphi, VB.NET, Python) and several operating systems (Windows, *nix family).

ALGLIB features include:
•	Data analysis (classification/regression, including neural networks)
•	Optimization and nonlinear solvers
•	Interpolation and linear/nonlinear least-squares fitting
•	Linear algebra (direct algorithms, EVD/SVD), direct and iterative linear solvers, Fast Fourier Transform and many other algorithms (numerical integration, ODEs, statistics, special functions)

ALGLIB Project (the company behind ALGLIB) delivers to you several editions of ALGLIB:
•	ALGLIB Free Edition - full functionality but limited performance and license
•	ALGLIB Commercial Edition - high-performance version of ALGLIB with business-friendly license

Free Edition is a serial version without multithreading support or extensive low-level optimizations (generic C or C# code). Commercial Edition is a heavily optimized version of ALGLIB. It supports multithreading, it was extensively optimized, and (on Intel platforms) - our commercial users may enjoy precompiled version of ALGLIB which internally calls Intel MKL to accelerate low-level tasks. We obtained license from Intel corp., which allows us to integrate Intel MKL into ALGLIB, so you don't have to buy separate license from Intel.
